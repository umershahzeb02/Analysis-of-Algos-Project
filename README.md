## üìã Question 1: Iterative and Recursive Algorithms for Maximizing Profit

### üîç Iterative Bottom-Up Algorithm with Memoization

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
Function maximizeProfitBottomUp(customTotalSize, customPrices)
    Create dp vector of size (customTotalSize + 1) with default CustomBurfi objects

    For i from 1 to customTotalSize
        For each price in customPrices
            Calculate customPortionSize
            If customPortionSize <= i
                potentialResult = dp[i - customPortionSize]
                potentialProfit = customPrice + potentialResult.customProfit
                If potentialProfit > dp[i].customProfit
                    Update dp[i].customProfit with potentialProfit
                    Update dp[i].customPath with potentialResult.customPath + customPortionSize

    Return dp[customTotalSize]
```

**‚è≤ Time Complexity**: `O(customTotalSize √ó n)`  
This approach efficiently computes the result by building up solutions and avoids redundant calculations using a dynamic programming table.

### üìâ Simple Recursive Top-Down Algorithm (Without Memoization)

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
Function maximizeProfitRecursive(customTotalSize, customPrices)
    If customTotalSize == 0
        Return new CustomBurfi with 0 profit and empty path
    Initialize customMaxResult as new CustomBurfi
    For each price in customPrices
        Calculate customPortionSize
        If customPortionSize <= customTotalSize
            Recursive call maximizeProfitRecursive
            If customCurrentProfit > customMaxResult.profit
                Update customMaxResult

    Return customMaxResult
```

**‚è≤ Time Complexity**: `O(n^(T/100))`  
Exponential growth makes this approach inefficient for larger inputs due to repeated subproblem calculations.

### üîÑ Recursive Top-Down Algorithm with Memoization

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
Function maximizeProfitRecursive(customTotalSize, customPrices)
    Check memoization cache
    If customTotalSize == 0
        Return new CustomBurfi with zero profit and empty path
    Initialize customMaxResult
    For each price in customPrices
        Calculate customPortionSize
        If customPortionSize <= customTotalSize
            Recursively call maximizeProfitRecursive
            If calculated profit > customMaxResult.profit
                Update customMaxResult
    Store in cache and return customMaxResult
```

**‚è≤ Time Complexity**: `O(customTotalSize √ó n)`  
Memoization avoids redundant calculations and optimizes the recursion depth, improving time complexity.

### ‚öñ Comparison

1. **Iterative Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming**:  
   Efficiently solves the problem with `O(customTotalSize √ó n)` time complexity.
2. **Recursive Top-Down (Naive)**:  
   Simple but exponential in time, not suitable for larger inputs.
3. **Recursive Top-Down with Memoization**:  
   Matches the time complexity of the bottom-up approach, improving efficiency with caching but risks stack overflow for deep recursion.

## üìö Question 2: Matrix Comparison for Pattern Matching

**Main Tasks**:

- **Matrix Initialization**:  
  Reads from the file and creates a square matrix and a pattern matrix.
- **Pattern Search**:  
  Compares diagonal positions in the matrix for pattern matching.

**‚è≤ Time Complexity**: `O(N^2 * M^2)`  
The comparison process involves nested loops to scan matrix diagonals, where `N` is the size of the matrix and `M` the pattern matrix.

## üö¶ Question 3: Path Calculation with Preprocessed Map

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
Function calculatePathTime(path)
    Split path into nodes
    Initialize totalTime = 0
    For each segment in nodes
        If segment found in path_times
            Add to totalTime
        Else
            Return error
    Return totalTime
```

**‚è≤ Time Complexity**:  
- **Reading path times**: `O(n)`
- **Path calculation**: `O(p √ó m)`  
  Efficient for multiple queries using a preprocessed map for fast lookups.

### üöÄ **Question 3: Part B - Finding Minimum and Maximum Paths**

#### üìã **Pseudocode:**

```python
Function findMinMaxPathTime():
    Initialize minPathTime to infinity
    Initialize maxPathTime to -1
    Initialize minPath and maxPath to empty strings
    
    For each path in pathsToCalculate:
        Call calculatePathTime for the path
        If time is valid:
            If path time is less than minPathTime:
                Update minPathTime and minPath
            If path time is greater than maxPathTime:
                Update maxPathTime and maxPath

    Return minPath, minPathTime, maxPath, maxPathTime
```

#### üîç **Explanation:**

1. **Functionality**:
    - This function is designed to find both the minimum and maximum travel times from the set of paths provided.
    - It loops through each path in the `pathsToCalculate` list, calling the `calculatePathTime` function for each.
    - It then compares the result with the current minimum and maximum travel times, updating as necessary.

2. **Variables**:
    - `minPathTime`: Stores the minimum time found so far, initialized to a large value (`infinity`).
    - `maxPathTime`: Stores the maximum time found so far, initialized to a small value (`-1`).
    - `minPath` and `maxPath`: Track the paths corresponding to the minimum and maximum times.

3. **Result**:
    - The function returns the path with the minimum time, its time, the path with the maximum time, and its time.

#### ‚è≥ **Time Complexity Analysis**:

- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs over all the paths in the `pathsToCalculate` list. Let `p` be the number of paths.
- **Path Time Calculation**: For each path, the `calculatePathTime` function is called, which takes `O(m)` time where `m` is the number of nodes in the path. In practice, `m` is generally small, so the complexity is dominated by the number of paths.
- **Comparisons**: Each path‚Äôs time is compared against the current minimum and maximum, which are constant-time operations.

Overall time complexity:
- **Total Time Complexity**: `O(p * m)`, where `p` is the number of paths to calculate and `m` is the number of nodes in each path.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Comparison with Simpler Solutions**:

1. **Naive Approach**:
    - In a naive approach, without maintaining the minimum and maximum during the loop, multiple passes through the data would be required to find the min and max.
    - This would lead to a time complexity of `O(p * m)` for calculating path times and an additional `O(p)` for finding the min and max in separate loops, resulting in `O(p * m + p)`.
    - The current approach is more efficient as it calculates everything in a single pass.

2. **Preprocessed Approach**:
    - In scenarios where the paths have been preprocessed (as in the previous part), we avoid redundant recalculations.
    - This approach avoids the need for recalculating path times multiple times, making it more efficient for repeated queries.

#### üìù **Conclusion**:
The current approach provides an efficient way to calculate both the minimum and maximum path times in one pass over the paths, with a time complexity of `O(p * m)`. This ensures optimal performance, especially for large sets of paths.
